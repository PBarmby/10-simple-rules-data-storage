### Glossary and Abbreviations used in the manuscript

#### Projects

* **GBIF** (Global Biodiversity Information Facility, http://www.gbif.org) provides
  an international open data infrastructure to publish and disseminate
  biodiversity information.

* **iDigBio** (Integrated Digitized Biocollections, https://www.idigbio.org) is a
  project funded by the National Science Foundation that facilitates the
  digitization of natural history collections, and provides data and images for
  biological specimens.

#### File Formats

* **CSV** (Comma-Separated Values) and **TSV** (Tab-Separated Values) are plain text
  file formats used to store tabular data where each row is represented by a line
  in the file, and each field (column) is separated by a comma for CSV or by the
  Tab character for TSV.

* **FASTA** is a simple file format used to represent sequences of nucleotides or
  amino-acids in plain text making it easy to manipulate programmatically.

* **HDF5** (Hierarchical Data Format) is an open-source binary file format designed
  to store large amount of data (and their associated metadata) by providing a
  hierarchical structure that could be compared to how a hard drive is organized
  with directories and files.

* **NetCDF** (Network Common Data Form) is an open-source binary file format
  designed to store large datasets in array-oriented scientific data as
  typically used in geosciences.

#### Programming and Algorithms

* Web **APIs** (Application Programming Interface) provide ways to query
  programmatically databases through the internet. They notably allow users to
  retrieve and work with a small slice of a large dataset.

* **MapReduce** is a style of programming designed to work with large datasets in
  parallel computing environments. Such programs are composed of a Map procedure
  where the dataset is sliced into several pieces, and a Reduce procedure where
  summary operations are applied to each of the slices.

* **MD5** is a Message Digest algorithm used in cryptographic hash functions often
  used to verify data integrity. A cryptographic hash function converts a
  "message" (e.g., passwords, file content) into an encrypted
  value. Cryptographic hash functions are easy to compute from the message, but
  it should be impossible to recover the message from the output, and any
  modifications to the message should also modify the output.

* **SQL** (Structure Query Language) is a programming language used to interact with
  relational database management systems.

#### Hardware

* **mega-, giga-, tera-, peta-bytes** are units of digital information and are used
  to measure the size of datasets or the storage media. Originally a byte was
  the minimum amount of memory needed to store a single character of text in a
  computer. The prefixes mega-, giga-, tera- and peta- refer to the
  international system of units for the multiple of the unit, and correspond to
  $10^{6}$, $10^{9}$, $10^{12}$, and $10^{15}$ abbreviated M, G, T and P
  respectively.

#### Persistent identifiers

* **ARK** (Archival Resource Key) identifiers are URLs designed to support long-term
  access to information online.

* **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier) provides unique and persistent identifiers for
  electronic documents (in particular journal articles and datasets) on the
  internet. The uniqueness of the identifiers is guaranteed by a central
  registry. By dissociating the identifier and the location of the document
  (i.e., the URL), the DOI can remain fixed even if its location changes.

* **PURL** (Persistent Uniform Resource Locator) is an URL used to redirect to the
  location of an electronic object on the internet. DOI and ARK are examples of
  implementations of PURL.

* **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator), the most familiar type of URLs are web
  addresses.
